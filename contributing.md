# Contributing

Thank you for taking a look at how to contribute and submit your theme.

## Guidelines

1. Although clean, readable code is recommended, it is not required for the theme to be added to this repo as it is not officially supported. However that will greatly increase the chanced of using their theme.


## Instrcutions

1. Create a repo with the required files, such as `userChrome.css` and links to whatever extensions are needed.
2. Add suitable instrcutions.
3. Create the markdown for `FirefoxCSS.md`. Scroll to below.

## Markdown
The theme above will end with `---` and you can start by adding the image. **A square image is highly recommended.**

```md
<img align="left" width="350px" src="">
```

After that, add a title with the format **Name by Author**, with links included. Like so:

```md
# [Name](https://github.com/...) by [Tnixc](https://github.com/...)
```
Note that both the links should be to the repo, not the author themselves.

Follow that, add a short description of the theme at most 4-5 lines long.
```md
A ... of ... in Firefox. Aims for ... Customizable ...
Inspired by ... by ...
```

**Most importanty, add an apporitate number of line breaks(`br`) to the end of your section** Note that the text should not wrap under the image when zoomed out.
```md
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
```
Lastly, add a divider to signify the end of the section
```md
---
```

### After the changes have been made correctly, open an issue under `dev` with the markdown attached.
