## Install

### General instructions- enabling userChrome
1. Enable userChrome customisation in `about:config`
    Navigate to `about:config` in the address bar and accept the risks.

2. Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and toggle it to `true` (by double clicking on it).
3. Locate and open your profile folder
Either of the following two methods work:

    Using the Firefox troubleshooting page
        Click on the ‚ò∞ icon ‚ûù `Help` ‚ûù `More Troubleshooting Information` or navigate to `about:support` in your address bar
        Under Application Basics, click on the `about:profiles`. Open the folder.

4. Create the folder and its files

    Inside your profile folder, create a new folder named `chrome` (all lower case)

    Inside the chrome folder, create two new files, `userChrome.css` and `userContent.css` (case sensitive)
        Note: In Windows, you must disable the "Hide extensions for known file types" setting in Explorer. Once that's done, simply create a new text file (Right click ‚ûù New ‚ûù Text Document), then make sure to replace the .txt with .css

5. Head over to the linked repositories and copy the contents of their `userChrome.css` to your own.

6. **Some themes may require extensions and other files so continue by following instructions on their repository.**

**!! If there is an issue with a theme create an issue on their repo NOT here !!**

# [Cascade](https://github.com/andreasgrafen/cascade) by [andreasgrafen](https://github.com/andreasgrafen/cascade)

**A minimalistic and keyboard centered userChrome**

Cascade aims to remove a lot of the subjective clutter default Firefox comes with. The theme is also highly inspired by the stylistic choices of [SimpleFox](https://github.com/migueravila/SimpleFox) ü¶ä by [Miguel √Åvila](https://github.com/migueravila).
